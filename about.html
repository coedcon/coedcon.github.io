    <h1>About COED: Computing On Encrypte Data</h1>

    <p class="lead"><h3>What Are COED Technologies?</h3></p>

    <p class="lead">Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), sometimes also called Partnership Enhancing Technologies, offer a way for companies to process data, whilst ensuring the privacy or confidentiality of the data remains in place, whilst allowing sharing data with external partners, or processing sensitive data. There are a variety of PET technologies, the majority are presented in the diagram below. Each technology is usually tailored to a specific method of processing data, and each has its own security and performance penalties.</p>

    <h3>Homomorphic Encryption (HE or FHE)</h3>
    <p class="lead">Homomorphic Encryption is a form of encryption allowing one to perform calculations on encrypted data without decrypting it first. The result of the computation is in an encrypted form, when decrypted the output is the same as if the operations had been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted.</p>

    <h3>Secure multi-party computation (MPC)</h3>
    <p class="lead">Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participantsâ€™ privacy from each other.</p>
